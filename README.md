# TestDevApp
Processing 3 | 2D Game Learn <br/>
Official processing site: https://processing.org/

This project was to create for my own learning. <br/>
Not having yet learned the use of PVector, Class or Object. <br/>
I wanted above all to put my skills into practice without these concepts. <br/>
It is very likely that the code has errors!

How to compile:
- Click on clone and download then download zip.
- Cut / paste on desktop
- Extract the zip
- Click on the TestDevApp-master folder and move the TestDevApp-master folder to your desktop
- Run TestAppDev.pde, prompting you to create a new folder. Click Ok
- Close the application
- Cut / paste all .pde files into the new create folder name "TestDevApp". As well as the data folder!
- Click on the TestDevApp folder and then restart TestAppDev.pde
- Execute and play

Have Fun and Enjoy!
